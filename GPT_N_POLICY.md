# MFEK GPT-_n_ Policy

**Parts of this project were written by a type of artificial intelligence, a language model called GPT-4, as that model existed in the month of March 2023.**

[GPT-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4) is a project of [OpenAI LP](https://openai.com/).

GitHub Copilot was not used. The MFEK Foundation Inc. funded API calls. **For `NUDGE`, â‰ˆ$10 in compute was used.**

MFEK pledges:

* All code generated was reviewed by a human (in practice Fred Brennan).
* All comments generated were reviewed for factual accuracy and removed if inaccurate.
* All code generated was tested and linted by a real compiler.
* GPT-4 was not told to just write code. It was given human-produced code and told to _translate_ it to Rust.
* Many functions are sent back to GPT-4 more than ten times; a few more than thirty.
